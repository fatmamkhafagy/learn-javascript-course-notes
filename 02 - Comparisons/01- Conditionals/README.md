##  Comparisons

> Learn how to compare values and write conditional statements in JavaScript.

---

###  In Simple Terms:

This lesson teaches you how to **compare values**, like checking if one thing is greater than another, or whether two things are equal.

You’ll also learn how to write **conditional statements**, which are instructions like:

> "If this happens, do this... otherwise, do something else."

---

###  What You’ll Learn:

- How to use comparison operators like `===`, `<`, `>=`, and more  
- How to make your code take different actions depending on different conditions  
- Example: If the password is correct → log the user in. If not → show an error message.

---

###  Why This Lesson Matters:

- You'll understand **how programs make decisions**
- You'll start writing code that is dynamic and smart, not just a fixed set of instructions
