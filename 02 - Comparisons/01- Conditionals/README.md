> In programming, "Conditionals" are also known as "if statements" or decision-making statements.

###  What This Lesson Is About

This lesson will teach you how to write code that **performs certain actions only if a specific condition is true**.

In other words, you're telling the computer:

> "If something happens, do this. If not, do something else."

###  What Does "Conditionals" Mean?

Simply put, it's a way for your code to **make decisions** based on what's happening in your program.

For example:
- If the user enters the correct password → log them in
- If not → show an error

###  Why Are Conditionals Important?

Because they help you write **smart, dynamic code** that responds to situations — not just a fixed script that runs the same way every time.

Any game, website, or app in the world uses conditionals at its core.
