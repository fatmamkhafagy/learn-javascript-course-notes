# Lesson 06: Numbers in JavaScript

In JavaScript, all numeric values—whether integers or floating-point numbers—are treated as a single type: `Number`.

Unlike Python, which distinguishes between `int` and `float`, JavaScript uses `Number` for everything:

```js
let x = 2;      // an integer
x = 5.69;       // a float
x = -5.42;      // a negative number

```

### Arithmetic Operations
JavaScript supports the basic arithmetic operations you're familiar with:

```js
let sum = 2 + 3 + 7;       // 12
let difference = 5.3 - 2.1; // 3.2
let product = 2 * 3;        // 6
let quotient = 6 / 2;       // 3

```

### Summary
- JavaScript uses a single Number type for all numeric values.
- You can use standard arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /.
- Decimal and negative numbers are treated the same way as integers.
