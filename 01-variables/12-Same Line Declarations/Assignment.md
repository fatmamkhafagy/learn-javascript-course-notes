## Task:

- At the top of the script, declare two constants on the same line:
- `averageOpenRate` with a value of `0.23`.
- `displayMessage` with a value of `"is the average open rate of your messages before they're logged"`.
- Below the declarations, use `console.log()` to print the values of both constants.
---
## Solution:
```js
const averageOpenRate = 0.23, displayMessage = "is the average open rate of your messages before they're logged";

// don't touch below this line
console.log("Average open rate:", averageOpenRate);
console.log("Display message:", displayMessage);
```
---
## Explanation:
**1- Declaring constants on the same line:**
- The `const` keyword is used to declare two constants in one line: `averageOpenRate` and `displayMessage`.  

- The first constant `averageOpenRate` is assigned the value `0.23`, and the second constant `displayMessage` is assigned the string `"is the average open rate of your messages before they're logged"`.  

- Using the same line to declare constants like this helps reduce the lines of code, making it more concise and organized.

**2-Printing the values with `console.log()`:**

- After declaring the constants, `console.log()` is used to output the values of `averageOpenRate` and `displayMessage`.  
- `console.log("Average open rate:", averageOpenRate);` will print the message `"Average open rate: 0.23"`.  
- `console.log("Display message:", displayMessage);` will print the message `"Display message: is the average open rate of your messages before they're logged"`.
