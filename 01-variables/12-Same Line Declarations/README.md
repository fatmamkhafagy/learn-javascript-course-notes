## Lesson 12 - Same Line Declarations

### Overview
In JavaScript, you can declare multiple variables in the same line. This technique helps keep your code concise and organized, especially when variables are closely related.
### Concept
- Declaring multiple variables on the same line can save space and improve readability.
- It's useful when you're declaring constants or variables that are logically connected.
### Example
Hereâ€™s an example of declaring multiple variables on one line:
```js
let miles = 80276, org = "Tesla";
```
---
This is the same as:

```js
let miles = 80276;
let org = "Tesla";
```
---
### Key Points
- Same Line Declarations allow you to declare multiple variables in a single line.  
- You can use `let` or `const` for this purpose.  
- It makes your code cleaner and helps group related variables together.
