The lessons will guide you through writing and testing code in your browser, and occasionally using the CLI on your local machine.

### Explanation of Key Terms:

- **Pretend project**: A fake project made just for learning and practicing. It’s not real, but it helps you learn how to build real things.

- **Textio**: The example app used in this course. It’s made-up, but it works like a real tool that sends text messages (SMS) to users.

- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: This means the software is used online, through a web browser. You don’t need to install anything — it runs on the internet.

- **Sending SMS**: Sending short text messages to people’s phones using code.

- **Writing and testing code in your browser**: You’ll write JavaScript code directly in your browser, and see the results right away — usually in the Developer Console.

- **CLI (Command Line Interface)**: A black screen (like Terminal or Command Prompt) where you type commands to control your computer and run your code.
