## Assignment: JavaScript Basic Types

Practice working with JavaScript's **primitive data types**:  
- `boolean`  
- `string`  
- `number`  
- `undefined`  

---

### Your Task:
Declare the following variables using `var` and assign them appropriate values based on the required data type.

Variables to define:
- `isOnline` → should be a **boolean**
- `userName` → should be a **string**
- `userAge` → should be a **number**
- `pendingMessage` → should be **undefined**

---

##  You Will Practice:
- **Declaring variables with `var`** → Telling the computer "Hey, I'm going to use a new variable."
- **Assigning values of correct types** → Giving your variables the right kind of value (string, number, etc.).
- **Using `typeof` to verify types** → typeof tells you what kind of value is inside your variable.  
     For example, if you do typeof "hello", it will say "string".  
     It helps you make sure you gave the right type of value.

###  Data Type Recap:

| Type        | Example Value       |
|-------------|---------------------|
| boolean     | `true`, `false`     |
| string      | `"Hello"`           |
| number      | `42`, `3.14`        |
| undefined   | `var x;` (no value) |

---

### Bonus Challenge:
Try changing the values and observe how `typeof` responds:
- What happens if you use quotes around a number?
- What if you leave a variable completely undeclared?
