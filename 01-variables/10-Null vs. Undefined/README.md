# Lesson 09: Null vs. Undefined in JavaScript

## Introduction
JavaScript has **two different values** that represent "nothing":

- `undefined`: It means the variable **has no value** yet. (It's very nothing.)
- `null`: It means the variable **has a value**, but the value is intentionally empty. (It's kinda nothing.)

This is a bit confusing at first, especially if you're coming from languages like Python where you only have one thing like `None`.

---

##  Real-Life Analogy
- `undefined`: You open a drawer and it's empty — because **you never put anything inside**.
- `null`: You open a drawer and there's a note inside saying "Nothing here" — you **put that note on purpose**.

---

##  Basic Examples
```js
let myName;
console.log(myName); // undefined → No value was assigned

let myAge = null;
console.log(myAge); // null → Value was assigned, but it means empty
```

---

##  typeof null (Weird Quirk)
```js
console.log(typeof null); // "object"
```
This is a **bug in JavaScript** from the early days. Technically, `null` is its own type, but `typeof null` returns `object` because of a historical issue.

##  Equality Comparison: `==` vs `===`
| Expression               | Result  | Explanation                                |
|--------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| `5 == "5"`              | `true`  | Compares value only (type is ignored)      |
| `5 === "5"`             | `false` | Compares value **and** type (strict match) |
| `null == undefined`     | `true`  | Both mean "nothing" loosely                |
| `null === undefined`    | `false` | Different types and meanings               |

>  Use `===` when you want to be **100% sure** the value and type match. It's more reliable.

##  Why It Matters
JavaScript is one of the few programming languages that makes a distinction between `null` and `undefined`.
Most of the time, they behave similarly, but **understanding the difference clearly will help you avoid bugs and confusion** in your code.

### Let's explain it simply:
- In other languages like Python, you only have one value like `None` to represent "nothing" or "no value".
- But in JavaScript, you have **two** options:

```txt
undefined = The computer is saying: "I don’t know the value yet — you haven’t told me anything!"
null = You’re saying: "I know what I’m doing — this value is empty on purpose."
```

So when your project gets bigger, it’s easy to forget whether you used `null` or just left something `undefined`. 
This can cause **bugs** or unexpected behavior in your program.

##  Final Summary
- `undefined`: Variable declared but not given a value yet.
- `null`: Variable explicitly set to be empty.
- `typeof null` returns `"object"` (a known bug).
- Use `===` for strict comparisons.
- Prefer `null` over `undefined` for clearer code when working in teams or larger codebases.

>  Learn the difference between `null` and `undefined` early, so you can write cleaner, safer code — especially in larger projects.
